# .Dotfiles SetupÂ 

Manage your dotfiles easily and cleanly using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

* * *

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone this repo into your home directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```
2. Change into the `.dotfiles` directory:

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
```
3. Use Stow to symlink your configs:

```bash
stow .
```

Thatâ€™s it! ðŸŽ‰ Your dotfiles are now symlinked into place.

* * *

### Setup and export $HOMEDIR

This is will create the ~/.localvars.sh and include HOMEDIR. Make sure you are in the directory you want to be your $HOMEDIR

```bash
echo "export HOMEDIR=\"$(pwd)\"" >> ~/.localvars.sh
```

* * *

## **ðŸ›  Manual Setup**

If youâ€™re migrating from an existing setup, follow these steps to back up and prepare.

### 1\. Create a Backup Directory

```bash
mkdir ~/backup-pre-dotfiles
```

### 2\. Backup Files and Folders

```bash
cd ~
cp .p10k.zsh .zprofile .zshrc backup-pre-dotfiles
cp -R .oh-my-zsh backup-pre-dotfiles
```

### 3\. Create the `.dotfiles` Directory

```bash
cd ~
mkdir .dotfiles
```

### 4\. Move Files to `.dotfiles`

```bash
mv .p10k.zsh .zprofile .zshrc .dotfiles
```

### 5\. Copy `oh-my-zsh/custom` into `.dotfiles`

```bash
cp -R ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom ~/.dotfiles/.oh-my-zsh
```

### 6\. Rename and Move `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom`

```bash
mv ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom.bak
```

### 7\. Install GNU Stow

```bash
brew install stow
```

### 8\. Apply Dotfiles with Stow

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
stow .
```

* * *

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

After setup, your `.dotfiles` directory should look like this:

```
.dotfiles/
â”œâ”€â”€ .p10k.zsh
â”œâ”€â”€ .zprofile
â””â”€â”€ .zshrc
```

_(Files inside `custom/` are just examples â€” add your own.)_

* * *

## ðŸ“Œ Common Stow Commands

Here are some useful commands youâ€™ll use often:

- **Stow everything**

```bash
stow .
```
- **Stow a single package (e.g., zsh configs)**

```bash
stow zsh
```
- **Unstow (remove symlinks for a package)**

```bash
stow -D zsh
```
- **Restow (refresh symlinks after changes)**

```bash
stow -R zsh
```
- **Dry-run (see what would happen, without changing files)**

```bash
stow -nv zsh
```
